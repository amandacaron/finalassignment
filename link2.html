Today you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!
<br/>
<br/>

The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.
<br/>
<br/>

Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.
<br/>
<br/>

Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.
<br/>
<br/>

A person's a person, no matter how small.
<br/>
<br/>

You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.
<br/>
<br/>

Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting. So. . . get on your way.
<br/>
<br/>

Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple.
<br/>
<br/>

Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.
<br/>
<br/>

I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living.

<p>
This speech may be a little different
Like a poem of some sorts
When thinking of what to speak about an idea came instantly
A famous person who is often quoted
While that could be Dr.Suess I noted
This speech may be a little odd
And yes indeed flawed
Please bear with me
As I try to help you see
How Dr. Suess made a difference through his work
<br/>
<br/>

Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple
A worldwide famous quote
That a man named Dr. Suess wrote
Theddor Suess Geisel born on March 2nd 1904
Came into the world and never left a bore
A famous known writer and cartoonist
That was a wonder opportunist
<br/>
<br/>

He first studied to be an English teacher
Yet pursuing a drawing career would mean he could create any creature
Many of Seuss's books express his views on social and political issues
None of which you will need tissues
<br/>
<br/>

Who started with political cartoons
Not just about world war two
And ended with children books
That are cherished up in our nooks
<br/>
<br/>

Forty six stories later
Dr. Seuss is a world wide known author
And a well-established creator
<br/>
<br/>

From known titles such as
If I ran a zoo
And Horton hears a who
<br/>
<br/>


His stories bring laughter and glee
Life lessons that could be
Inspirational quotes to shape someone
Words that would affect more then a dozen
Not just me and you
But maybe even your cousin too
<br/>
<br/>

A man part of most of your childhoods
Someone who put life lessons throughout his books
Saying A person's a person, no matter how small
And don't judge green eggs and ham because nothing was made to impress us all
To go on journeys, take risks; get back up after you fall
To Think and wonder, wonder and think
Live your own life out of sync
<br/>
<br/>

One may not see what Dr. Suess has accomplished
He helped our futures, didn't sugar coat it or add any fancy nail polish
We are in college now
Time goes by fast
But as the Seuss once said
You have brains in your head, you have feet in your shoes you can steer yourself any direction you choose
You're on your own. And you know what you know. And you are the one who'll decide where to go
Only you can control your future and
Will you succeed? Yes you will indeed, ninety-eight and three-quarters percent guaranteed
Expand your mind
think left and think right and think low and think high oh the things you can think up if only you try
<br/>
<br/>

To break things down from story to story
How Suess expressed himself without being gory
Lessons combined with fun rhymes
Creatures created to enhance great times
Seuss's work is more then a few children's novels
It is memorable messages that wont cause any grovel
<br/>
<br/>

He taught us to appreciate the little things in life
In the Lorax the importance of nature is the main focus
How Cutting down trees can change the world before you even notice
Once things are gone they can't be replaced
Evolution can be affected and bad things can happen
Because unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, its not
<br/>
<br/>

In Horton Hears a Who
Horton fights for what he believes in, despite the odds
Again I must add A persons a person no matter how small
Express what you believe in
Embrace life, go have a ball
Be different be you don't be afraid to sprawl
<br/>
<br/>

In one fish two fish red fish blue fish
Dr. Seuss expresses how all the fish are different in their own way
For reasons he didn't have to say
Because not one of them is like another. Don't ask us why, go ask your mother
Individuality is key and nothing other
<br/>
<br/>

The classic How the Grinch stole Christmas
The bitter Grinch learns that perhaps Christmas is more than presents and feasting: Maybe Christmas, he thought, means a little bit more.
Cindy Lou believed in him when no one else did
And his heart grew almost too big
Seuss's goal was too express
The materialism and consumerism of the Christmas season
Some of which are much more complicated and don't have a simple reason
<br/>
<br/>

Sam I am, Horton, Cat in the Hat, The Lorax
Many main characters stayed true to themselves
And believed in what the pleased
<br/>
<br/>

Dr. Seuss promotes being yourself
Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive that is Youer than You.
To think why fit in when you were born to stand out
And to be who you are and say what you feel because those who matter don't mind and those who mind don't matter
Lessons that true friends are there
Just be you and they shouldn't care
They should be themselves with you, not just stare
<br/>
<br/>


Enjoy life and learn everyday
the more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go
how Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting, so get on your way
Do what makes you happy
Take your time, don't be snappy
because when you stop and look around, this life is pretty amazing
This is true I swear, I'm not just paraphrasing
Don't over think situations
don't cry because its over, smile because it happened
 <br/>
 <br/>

I hope this speech didn't confuse many of you
Its focused on Dr.Seuss's works and I threw in many quotes too
Dr.Seuss may not be very famous in your eyes
But to me he seems very wise
Writing about what he believed in
While adding some fun twists and a little spin
He wrote from his heart
And that is just the start
Seuss taught great lessons in his text
To help us see what life might bring next
<br/>
<br/>

Thank you all for listening
I hope this speech was a little fun
I must say rhyming is a task
So Seuss there could beat us all zero to one
